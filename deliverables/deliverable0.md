What is the project focus/overall goal?
As stated in the project description for Small Business with Councillor Worrel, the purpose of this project is to understand the current landscape of small businesses in District 4. With more context into the small business landscape, the current gaps that exist can be identified and analyzed. The goal is to see what will attract more small businesses to the area while understanding the current issues small businesses face.

What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
We will collect a list of businesses for district 4 using the BDPA data and District 4 shape file and organize the data around business type to identify trends and gaps as well as identify business owner demographics. We will analyze data to answer the Base Project questions and then work on analyzing additional data for the Extension Project.
City Council Districts Shape File
BPDA business listings
Foot traffic based on cell phone mobility data – Cubiq from BPDA
MBE database (women and minority owned businesses)
City of Boston MBE Database
Registry of MBEs in Massachusetts
Business licenses:
Entertainment/ liquor licenses 
Ratings of businesses/amenities

What are potential limitations of the project?
Potential limitations of the project may include the accuracy of negative effects on small businesses corresponding directly to only District 4; there could be negative effects found that are not specific to this district. These effects could limit approaches on how to generate a profitable small business community. 

It is also possible that limiting the data to only small businesses in District 4 could narrow possible solutions because there may be a set of solutions that are applicable to District 4 which come from analyzing another set of data points. 

Determining foot traffic based on cell phone data could be slightly skewed, however still useful. But not every person holding a phone walking through a certain area could be considered as a potential customer.

Why is this project important or Why did you choose this project?
This project is important because it will offer insight into the successes and shortcomings of small businesses in District 4. With this information, the city government can make informed decisions on what aspects to improve upon and focus on to most effectively support small businesses, as well as make District 4 an attractive place to locate to. Allowing small businesses to thrive can improve the community as a whole. 

With the growing population of chain stores, we are interested in seeing how small businesses are faring in comparison and ways for them to succeed in the community. 

What are your team’s next steps? (include action items/tasks)
We will begin by collecting data and creating a Data Set for District 4:
Get a list of businesses for district 4 using the BPDA data and District 4 shape file 
Classify the data by business type and identify trends and gaps
Identify business owner demographics
Search for overalaps  in the list of minority owned businesses for Boston and the State Registry of MBEs in Massachusetts.
Append data from the BPDA data:
cell phone traffic from cuqiq or safe graph
Identify # of similar nearby businesses e.g. within .25 miles or .5 miles (confirm with Lindsey)
